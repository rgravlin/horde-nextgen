# horde-nextgen

Neon Horde: a top-down twin-stick "horde" survival shooter on three.js r186
(`WebGPURenderer`, WebGPU first with an automatic WebGL2 fallback), driven by a
deterministic 60 Hz simulation in plain TypeScript.

Requirements: Node >= 22 (the sandbox runs 22.11.0) and `npm install` once with
network access — everything after that runs offline.

## Commands

Run them in the repo root:

    npm run dev         # vite dev server on http://127.0.0.1:5173
    npm test            # vitest run — unit tests, tests/unit/**, plain Node (no DOM)
    npm run test:e2e    # playwright test — browser scenarios, tests/e2e/** (Chromium + SwiftShader)
    npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
    npm run build       # tsc --noEmit && vite build -> dist/
    npm run bench       # tsx tools/bench.ts — headless sim perf gate

`npm run typecheck`, `npm test` and `npm run build` are the checks every change
has to leave green.

## Where things live

[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) has the modules, the data flow and where tests
belong; [TECH.md](TECH.md) the pinned engine versions and why they were chosen;
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) the look. How to add a weapon, an enemy, a level or a
model goes here once there is something to add to — see `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the
rules a new piece of content has to follow.
